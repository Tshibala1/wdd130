        <p>Hello, My name is Franck Tshibala, and I'm originally from the Congo where I grew up with a love of soccer. I played on local teams and in the streets with my friends whenever I could. Now I'm dedicated to my studies in software development. I love learning how to code and create programs that can help people in their daily lives.

        <p>Kinshasa is the sprawling, densely populated capital and largest city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Located on the Congo River in the west of the country near the border with the Republic of Congo, Kinshasa has an estimated population exceeding 12 million, making it the third largest urban area in Africa behind Lagos and Cairo. The city became the capital at Congolese independence in 1960 and underwent several name changes over time before taking on its current Lingala name, Kinshasa. Today, Kinshasa is the epicenter of political and economic activity in the DRC, with key industries like food processing, construction materials, plastics and textiles. Kinshasa remains the heartbeat of Congolese culture, with its cosmopolitan blend of people and vibrant music, fashion and arts scenes.</p>
